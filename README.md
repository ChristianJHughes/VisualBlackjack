# Visual Blackjack
<b>A simple window based Blackjack game built in Visual Studio, using C#.</b>

This program demonstrates reactive forms, MVC architecture, and an underlying library of objects representing the game components.

<b>Rules:</b>
The player competes against a computerized "House" player in a game of tradtional Blackjack. The program emulates a 52 card deck, with random shuffling occuring after the entire deck has been played. As is the case with most casino house players, the computer will stop asking for hitting after attaining a score of 17 or more.

The standard rules for Blackjack can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack).
